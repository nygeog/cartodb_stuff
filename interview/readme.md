Meeting with Dani. This would be a formal interview and he'd like you to demo the teaching of a technical skill related to web mapping. The goal is teaching the technical to make it easy. The format is around **10 minutes**. 

It should be something of your choosing that matches the top skills in the posting: https://cartodb.com/jobs/technical-trainer/

I'd aim it at people with GIS experience but maybe aren't as familiar with what web development looks like. Think JS + SQL + APIs. While way too involved for this demo, I always look to Eric Brelsford's Urban Reviewer (source code) as a great example of a mashup like this.

How about <strike>Monday at 3pm</strike> or **Tuesday at 2pm**?

Cheers,
